I have used react for my blog.
I have used Node.js dependency.

Steps to run:

1. You must install the node.js
   Link: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Open terminal
3. Change the directory to the folder where all code present
4. run command "npm install" - this creates node_modules folder which are required
5. Run command " npm start" to run react
