        <h1>LET’S SEE SOME LATEST NEWS IN GAMING</h1>
        <p>I've been passionate about hobbies my whole life. I love learning, collecting, researching and developing new skills. Some of these skills have proven useful in my career, and some are just for me to enjoy. Today we're gonna talk about the private ones. The ones that make life better and help us decompress at the end of a long day. </p>

        My “hobby” is gaming. I usually don’t use the term hobby, but I play quite often. Gaming is my way to relax. I spend my free time playing games online with my friends and it’s the way I connect with my friends. Gaming means to me a lot. I think could not live without my pc! My inspiration in gaming begun when I got a Ps2  for my birthday present a long time ago. My favourite games are League of Legends, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Warframe, Fallout franchise and Skyrim.

        <h2>1. It sucks that Half-Life:alyx is VR only, but I'm still Excited for more half Half-Life. </h2>
        <p>
        Half-Life 2 is probably my favorite game of all time, with my other option being Half-Life 1. I wanted to start with that sentence because I think it really helps explain my love for the Half-Life franchise. And as a lifelong, hardcore, super Half-Life fan I’m excited to play Half-Life: Alyx, even if it means I have….

        <h2>
          2. Natus Vincere recruit new support pubstar illias for Dota 2 roster.
        </h2>
        <p>Na’Vi previously benched Akbar “SoNNeikO” Butaev, its previous position five and captain, due to “unsatisfactory results at [the] MDL Chengdu Major Qualifier.” The Ukrainian organization only managed to win two games at the qualifier, losing even to pub stacks that formed for the event.
        </p>
        <p>
        Illias is a virtual unknown and will make his competitive debut with Na’Vi. At just 17 years old, he’s one in the long line of pubstars that other CIS organizations have plucked directly from the pipeline this year, like Virtus Pro picking up Egor “epileptick1d” Grigorenko and Vitalie “Save-” Melnic.

          3. Old world of warcraft glitch created a terrifying instant death bear.
        </h2>
        <p>
        World of Warcraft contains countless fantastical creatures with otherworldly powers. Legendary dragons, skyscraper-sized fire elementals, several different kinds of boar—the list goes on. One beast from the game’s distant past, however, put them all to shame. I speak of the Death Bear of the Arathi Highlands, though I…
